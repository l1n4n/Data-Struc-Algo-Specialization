"""
Input Format. first line----n: the number of vertices and edges in the graph. m: the number of vertices
Each of the next m lines contains two integers u and v â€” the numbers of vertices connected by an edge. 

Output Format. a boolean formula in the conjunctive normal form (CNF). 
If it is possible to color the vertices of the input graph in 3 colors such that any two vertices
connected by an edge are of different colors, the formula must be satisfiable. 
Otherwise, the formula must be unsatisfiable.
